            <p>Hello, my name is 王鴻洲, my English name is Raphael Austin
                Adiputra Ong. My student ID is 111110539 and I am a first year in the Computer Science
                Department in National Quemoy University as an overseas Chinese Student from Indonesia.
                 <br><br> This website is created originally by a YouTuber named Online Tutorials. 
                 I referenced his videos to make this website. Over the years, I also practiced a lot from his videos
                and it has helped me improve in terms of designing a website using HTML,
                CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>I did this specific front end webpage design because
                I have always been interested in the way that these animations work. Upon the years,
                I grew fond of desining webpages and I specifically practiced this one a lot. I wanted
                to take it upon myself and try use other images for this specific setting and design, but
                during the editing of the pictures, my photo editing software PhotoShop has crashed
                and failed to save my pictures. In result, I decided to use the same background pictures
                as he used in his tutorial.<br><br>I understood the concept of this website and how
                to recreate it again. I didn't use ChatGPT for this website at all. I just fully referenced
                it from the YouTube Tutorial and I hope that's okay.<br><br>I would also like to say that I am
                truly grateful for the opportunity of studying with you for I have learnt further about critical points
                of designing a website, and more.</p>
